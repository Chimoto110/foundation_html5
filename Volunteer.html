    <h1> Volunteering</h1>
    <p>
        “You make a living by what you get.  You make a life by what you give…” – Winston Churchill
If you have ever volunteered before, be it with a local animal shelter, a care home, your church, or even in a foreign country; you will understand the impact that volunteering can make. Being a volunteer isn’t just about helping out in the community or giving back, it’s also about personal growth and development.

Many of our former volunteers from KCH have told us that the time they spent in Nairobi was quite simply, life-changing.

"Before volunteering with KCH I only had a small knowledge about children's homes and how they are run. From the most extreme situations, these children are growing into future leaders and I have been lucky enough to hold their hand and walk alongside them for a small part of their journey onto a better and brighter life." Cecile, Denmark

Whatever stage you may be in your life, enjoying a gap year after school or university, taking a career break or searching for something to expand your horizons during your summer break, KCH can offer placements from 2 months to 6 months and in some cases even longer.

We offer free accommodation, free lunch on the days where you are working and we’re one of the very few organisations who won’t charge you a programme fee.  You simply pay for flights, vaccinations and travel insurance and any additional living costs you might have when you are in Kenya.  Volunteering should be about passion, not about the size of your wallet!

   <h1> Volunteer Stories</h1>
   <ol>
    <li>Alex Musyoki</li>
    <p>Jordanian youth dedicate their time to building a better future. 
        Their volunteer efforts ripple through communities, creating positive change</p>

    <li>Linda Nifa</li>
    <p>

         providing essential support to students facing hunger. 
         Volunteering made a tangible difference in addressing food insecurity
    </p>

    <li>Mwanahamisi Hamadi</li>
    <p>
        Hamadi worked with a group of kids, allowing them to write about anything they wanted. Their creativity—robot dogs, intergalactic adventures, and rainbows—was boundless. 
        Encouraging their imaginations was profoundly rewarding
    </p>

    <li>Julius Yego</li>
    <p>
        Taylor and friends volunteered at a local shelter during dinner service. They helped prepare meals, served with kindness, and cleaned up afterward. Despite feeling that their impact was small, moments of connection—extended eye contact,
         a compliment, or a smile—made it worthwhile
    </p>

    <li>Fredrick Odhiambo</li>
    <p>
"I lost everything during the conflict in Syria, I left my belongings and my home and came to Jordan. 
I was psychologically tired and needed a way to get busy." Anas has suffered from the conflict in Syria,
 he came to Jordan with nothing in his hands but his degree in mechanical engineering and his hopes for
  better opportunities in life. Since his arrival, therefore, he has quickly begun to engage 
in various programmes to meet the needs of his family and children.

      Our best wishes go out to all our volunteers and supporters at this difficult time.

   <h4>Ann Gloag New Year's Honours Announcement</h4>
   <p>
    Ann Gloag said. “I am humbled and grateful to receive this Honour.  Never in my wildest dreams growing up in a council house in Perth did I think this would ever happen.  

“I am pleased the Honour mentions my nursing as what I learned as a nurse, dealing with people from all walks of life, 
helped me succeed in business and has been the cornerstone of my charitable work. 

“Whilst this Honour is being given to me, I would like to pay tribute to everyone who helped us 
build Stagecoach into the success it has become and thank all our staff and supporters of our charities
 who are too many to mention.”
